# Introduction

This document describes how to configure hardware by using crystal oscillator and TCC805x and provides design guide for optimum performance.

&nbsp;

## Basic Feature of Crystal Oscillator

This chapter describes the basic feature of crystal oscillator.

&nbsp;

### Basic Circuitry of Crystal Oscillator

Most of the Integrated Circuits (IC)s use an external crystal oscillator as a clock source.

&nbsp;

The features of typical crystal oscillator are as follows:

- Cost effective

- Low power consumption

- Stability as parallel oscillator circuit

&nbsp;

Figure 1.1 shows the typical crystal oscillator circuit.

**Figure 1.1 Crystal Oscillator Circuit**

&nbsp;

Normally, each part in the circuit operates as follows:

- Inverting Amplifier: Internal inverter as an amplifier

- R<sub>F</sub>: Feedback resistor to bias the amplifier

- R<sub>S</sub>: Series resistor to limit amplifier gain and reduce power dissipation in the crystal

- C<sub>L1</sub>, C<sub>L2</sub>: Load capacitance of the crystal

- C<sub>S</sub>: Parasitic capacitance (Refer to Chapter 1.2.6.)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Parameters of Crystal Specification

To select an adaptive crystal for circuit design, you should find the appropriate parameters in the crystal datasheet. Crystal vendors support several parameters that are important to design the circuit for the optimum board performance.

Table 1.1 describes normal parameters in the crystal datasheet.

**Table 1.1 Crystal Parameter**

|           **Parameter**            |    **Symbol**    |  **Unit**  | **Remark** |
| :--------------------------------: | :--------------: | :--------: | :--------: |
|             Frequency              |  f<sub>O</sub>   | kHz or MHz |  @ 25 °C   |
|        Frequency Tolerance         | Δf/f<sub>O</sub> |    ppm     |            |
|        Frequency Stability         | Δf/f<sub>O</sub> |    ppm     |            |
|          Drive Level (DL)          |        DL        |     µW     |  Maximum   |
| Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR) |        R1        |     Ω      |  @ 25 °C   |
|          Load Capacitance          |  C<sub>O</sub>   |     pF     |            |
|         Shunt Capacitance          |  C<sub>O</sub>   |     pF     |            |

&nbsp;

### Frequency

Normally, f<sub>O</sub> indicates the operating frequency of the crystal.

&nbsp;

### Frequency Tolerance

Frequency tolerance (Δf/f<sub>O</sub>) is a frequency deviation, which is a factor that indicates the accuracy of the crystal clock at 25 °C.

And it measures how close the crystal clock is to the desired frequency.

The frequency tolerance factor is usually defined in parts per million (ppm).

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### Frequency Stability

Frequency stability defines the frequency deviation over the given operating temperature range.

The frequency stability factor is usually defined in parts per million (ppm).

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### Drive Level

Drive Level DL indicates the maximum amount of the crystal that can be consumed while maintaining the specified performance.

DL is a measurement of the power applied to the resonator by inverting the amplifier in the External Crystal Oscillator (ECO) circuit.

A high DL causes damage such as reducing the life-cycle in your system. Therefore, you should select the crystal oscillator to meet the DL specification.

Usually, crystal vendors specify the maximum DL that may be applied to their crystal oscillator in the datasheet.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### Equivalent Series Resistance

Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR) indicates the resistive value of the crystal equivalent circuit with the resonating frequency.

If you design the system with low ESR crystal, the crystal can be damaged at high DL. If you design the system with high ESR crystal, the system can be unstable.

The ESR is typically specified as a maximum resistance value.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### Load Capacitance

Load capacitance (C<sub>L</sub>) is the total capacitance of C<sub>L1</sub> and C<sub>L2</sub> in Figure 1.1. To correct the operation with stable frequency, you should adjust C(L) value.

The C<sub>L</sub> is calculated by the following equation:

<ZoomableImage src="https://ye-eun-kang.github.io/documentimage/images/TCC805x/HW/Application%20Note/Crystal%20Design/image-20250612131955890.png" width="90%" />

The parasitic capacitance (C<sub>S</sub>) value is determined by the designed PCB pattern.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### Shunt Capacitance

Shunt capacitance (C<sub>O</sub>) is the capacitance of non-resonant frequency.

Figure 1.2 shows the crystal equivalent circuit.

<ZoomableImage src="https://ye-eun-kang.github.io/documentimage/images/TCC805x/HW/Application%20Note/Crystal%20Design/image-20250612132124558.png" width="90%" />

&nbsp;

## Main Clock

Most clocks used in TCC805x are generated from the main clockthat consists of crystal oscillator. The main clock is defined as the basic clock to operate each system block by using the clocks. (Example, PCIe and USB)

Table 2.1 describes the recommended crystal model and values of external components for main clock.

The data includes second, minute, hour, date, day of the week, month, and year. The RTC can also perform the alarm function.

&nbsp;

## DP Clock (Optional)

TCC805x consists of DP PHY. The DisplayPort (DP) supports the next generation video display interface technology. The Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) defines the DP standard as an open digital communications interface for use in internal as well as external connections. TCC805x is compliant to the DP specification V1.4. The DP complies with both High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) 1.3 and HDCP 2.2 standards. For details on the DP, refer to “*TCC805x Full Specification*” \[2\].

TCC805x supports the following two options for DP clock source: dedicated external crystal and sharing main clock.

TCC805x EVB is designed to use the main clock for DP clock source.

If you want to design the circuit with an external crystal oscillator, you should design the crystal circuit as described in Table 2.3.

# How to design Crystal circuit 

## How to design Crystal Circuit

This chapter describes how to design the crystal circuit and PCB layout, and the tuning result of TCC805x EVB.

&nbsp;

### PCB Layout

During PCB layout, consider and check the followings:

- XIN/XTIN and XOUT/XTOUT traces do not overlap.

- Crystal and load capacitor ground must consist of a single ground for low impedance.

- Crystal traces and ground should be isolated from noisy signals to avoid coupling.

- Crystal ground plane should be connected to the reference ground through VIA.

- Crystal circuit related components and traces are located as close as possible.

&nbsp;

To find the optimum performance of the designed board, you should request a test report of crystal resonant frequency to the crystal vendors. The crystal vendors will provide the optimum value of external components on the designed board.

In most cases, crystal vendors provide the test report as described in Table 3.1.

**&nbsp;**

**Table 3.1 Example: Crystal Test Report**

| **DL (µW)** | **Negative Resistance (Ω)** | **Frequency Tolerance (ppm)** |
|:-----------:|:---------------------------:|:-----------------------------:|
|     30      |             400             |             -1.05             |

&nbsp;

Table 3.1 is an example of test report and you should check the following lists.

- **Negative Resistance**

  - If the value of negative resistance gets higher, the stability improves, but EMI performance decreases.

- **Frequency Tolerance**

  - In general, the frequency tolerance is an important parameter of the clock specification for the fast and sensitive system block.

  - Beacuse the clock used in TCC805x is based on the main clock and RTC clock, minimizing the crystal deviation can reduce an error of each system clock and provide a more stable system.

  &nbsp;

  &nbsp;
