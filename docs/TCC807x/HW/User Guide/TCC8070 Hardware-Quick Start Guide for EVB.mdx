# EVB Preparation

## Supplying 12V Power to EVB

12V power adapter is included in the EVB kit.

Supply 12V power to the EVB by following the steps below:

1.  Connect the provided DC 12V power adapter with the 110/220V power cable.

2.  Check the 12V output.

3.  Connect the DC 12V power adapter to the DC-JACK (J11) on the TCC807x main board.

<ZoomableImage src="https://ye-eun-kang.github.io/documentimage/images/TCC807x/User%20Guide/TCC8070%20Hardware-Quick%20Start%20Guide%20for%20EVB/image-20250613084807782.png" width="45%" />

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Connecting UART of EVB to Computer

The EVB’s UART interface will be provided on the main board or sub-board depending on the manufacturer’s parts supply and demand situation.

The supported debug of the UART interface is as follows:

- Main Cluster (Cortex-A76)

- Sub-cluster (Cortex-A55)

- Storage Core

- Internal ISP

&nbsp;

### Debug of UART I/F on TCC807x Main Board

The EVB communicates with your computer by using a serial interface. The TCC807x main board uses USB Type-C connector for debugging.

**Caution:** Do not confuse the USB Type-C connector with the general USB Type-C connector used in mobile phones.

Connect the EVB to your computer by following the steps below:

1. Prepare one USB Type-C cable (ST-A type to ST-C type).
2. Connect one side of the USB Type-C cable (ST-A type to ST-C type) to the TCC807x main board’s USB Type-C connector (JC1).
3. Connect the other side of the USB Type-C cable (ST-A type to ST-C type) to your computer.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### Debug of UART I/F with TCC80XX_UART_CP2102 (UART Sub-board)

The EVB communicates with your computer by using a serial interface.

TCC80XX_UART_CP2102 (UART sub-board) uses a USB Type-C connector for debugging.

&nbsp;

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Do not confuse the USB Type-C connector with the general USB Type-C connector used in mobile phones.

&nbsp;

Connect the EVB to your computer by following the steps below:

1. Prepare three USB Type-C cables (ST-A type to ST-C type).

2. Connect one side of the USB Type-C cable (ST-A type to ST-C type) to the UART sub-board’s USB Type-C connector (JC3) to output the debug message of the Main cluster (Cortex-CA76) of the TCC8070.

   Connect the other side of the USB Type-C cable (ST-A type to ST-C type) to your computer.

3. Connect one side of the USB Type-C cable (ST-A type to ST-C type) to the UART sub-board’s USB Type-C connector (JC1) to output the debug message of the Sub-cluster (Cortex-CA55) of the TCC8070.

   Connect the other side of the USB Type-C cable (ST-A type to ST-C type) to your computer.

4. Connect one side of the USB Type-C cable (ST-A type to ST-C type) to the UART sub-board’s USB Type-C connector (JC2) to output the debug message of the Storage core of the TCC8070.

   Connect the other side of the USB Type-C cable (ST-A type to ST-C type) to your computer.

5. Connect one side of the USB Type-C cable (ST-A type to ST-C type) to the UART sub-board’s USB Type-C connector (JC4) to output the debug message of the ISP of the TCC8070.

   Connect the other side of the USB Type-C cable (ST-A type to ST-C type) to your computer.

&nbsp;

## Connecting EVB to JTAG Debugger

Connect the EVB to the JTAG debugger by following the steps below:

1.  Prepare the JTAG debugger.
1.  Connect the JTAG debugger for system debug to the JTAG header (J10D1) on the TCC8070 CPU board.

<ZoomableImage src="https://ye-eun-kang.github.io/documentimage/images/TCC807x/User%20Guide/TCC8070%20Hardware-Quick%20Start%20Guide%20for%20EVB/image-20250613085210310.png" width="45%" />

&nbsp;

## Connecting EVB to FWDN on Computer

The EVB uses Firmware Downloader (***FWDN***) to update the SDK. The EVB communicates with your computer by using High Speed USB. The TCC8070 CPU board includes a USB Micro Type-AB connector (JC5).

&nbsp;

**Note:** To prevent the collision of USB connection between EVB and PC when USB 2.0 DRD port is in host mode, the USB cable for ***FWDN*** is changed to USB Micro Type cable.

&nbsp;

Connect EVB to ***FWDN*** on your computer by following the steps below:

1.  Prepare one USB Micro type cable.
1.  Check the USB boot mode switch on the TCC8070 CPU board.
1.  Connect the DC 12V power adapter.
1.  Connect the USB Micro type cable to USB Micro Type-A/B connector (JC5) for ***FWDN*** on the CPU board.
1.  Connect the USB Micro type cable from step 4 to your computer.
